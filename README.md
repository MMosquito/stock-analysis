# MEASURING STOCK MARKET PERFORMANCE

## OVERVIEW

    Steve is researching the stock market to determine the best investments for his first clients, his parents!  Although they are interested in green energy it may be more beneficial if they diversify their portfolio.  Through Excel we are going to analyze the data with accuracy and efficiency.  

### Purpose

    Provide Steve's parents with consolidated information from the entire stock market to determine which stocks performed best in 2017 and 2018.  

### Background

    The stock market information Steve has is multi-faceted and may be overwhelming to non-finance people looking at it for the first time.  The All Stocks Analysis tab was created to give Steve and his clients a dataset that is clean, straight forward, and easy to read.  

## RESULTS

    As determined by the data set analysis over 90% of the 2017 Returns were in the "green", basically 11 out of 12 tickers had positive returns.  By the time 2018 arrived the situation had reversed and only 2 out of 12 tickers had positive returns. These results can provide historical information for a particular stock based on daily volume.

## SUMMARY

    There are various ways this code could have been written to provide Steve the information he needed to ensure he was giving his clients the best information.  Refactoring code from other projects with similar requirements has its challenges, but through repetition and familiarization in a programming language the task can be done in lightning speed. 

    

## REFACTORING CODE

### Advantages:  

The advantage of refactoring code is the availability of the initial shell of code.  Incorporating new code may save a professional an overwhelming amount of time with already available code. If someone is very knowledgeable in a particular coding language refactoring may also be more beneficial. 

### Disadvantages:  

The disadvantage of refactoring code is if someone is not knowledgeable in a programming language it can be more confusing than if someone started with a clean slate. This could inevitably lead to more problems with the code and could be more time consuming in the end.
